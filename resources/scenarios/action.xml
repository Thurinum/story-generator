				This so-called "novel" is the apotheosis of stupidity. It is utterly shocking that such an foolish absurdity managed to get inside the libraries themselves.

				<var name="protagonist" />
				is the living proof that we should burn books.
			</static>
			<static>
				Terrible. Hardly worth a read.
